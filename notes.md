# My Notes
This is a test to help me figure out why the git feature in IdeaCommunity isn't working right.

Actually, I just needed to update the current branch in IIC. Now everything's up to date. Hopefully this will
    all get much more natural throughout the course of the semester as I use GitHub and IIC itself more.
