# My Notes
This is a test to help me figure out why the git feature in IdeaCommunity isn't working right.

Actually, I just needed to update the current branch in IIC. Now everything's up to date. Hopefully this will
    all get much more natural throughout the course of the semester as I use GitHub and IIC itself more.

Now I'm going to try to fork the repo and manage a pull request. I've never done that either, and I think that this
    will be a really simple way to try it for the first time.

Actually, I think I might have accidentally modified fork-test and main at the same time. Now I'll try to actually
    commit this paragraph **ONLY** to fork-test
